# Elastic Stack SIEM Solution Deployment Project

This project demonstrates the deployment of a comprehensive Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution using the Elastic Stack, Suricata, and Filebeat on Ubuntu Server 22.04.

## Project Overview

This SIEM solution integrates the following components:

- Elasticsearch for log storage and indexing
- Logstash for log processing and enrichment
- Kibana for log visualization and analysis
- Filebeat for log shipping
- Suricata as the Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

## Architecture

```

         v
  [Elasticsearch] <--> [Kibana]
```

## Key Features

1. Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) deployment on Ubuntu Server 22.04
2. Suricata NIDS installation and configuration
3. Filebeat setup for shipping Suricata logs
4. Custom Logstash pipeline for processing Suricata alerts
5. Kibana dashboards for visualizing Suricata alerts

## Repository Structure

- `/elasticsearch-config/`: Elasticsearch configuration files
- `/logstash-config/`: Logstash pipeline and configuration files
- `/kibana-config/`: Kibana configuration and dashboard exports
- `/filebeat-config/`: Filebeat configuration files
- `/suricata-config/`: Suricata configuration and custom rules

## Setup and Configuration

Please refer to the following guides for detailed setup instructions:

1. [Elasticsearch Setup](elasticsearch-config/elasticsearch-setup.md)
2. [Logstash Setup](logstash-config/logstash-setup.md)
3. [Kibana Setup](kibana-config/kibana-setup.md)
4. [Filebeat Setup](filebeat-config/filebeat-setup.md)
5. [Suricata Installation and Configuration](suricata-config/suricata-setup.md)

## Usage

After setting up the SIEM solution, you can:

1. Monitor network traffic and alerts through Suricata
2. View and analyze logs in Kibana
3. Use custom Kibana dashboards to visualize Suricata alerts and other relevant data

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS
- Root or sudo access to the server
- Basic knowledge of Linux command line and networking concepts

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/elastic-stack-siem.git
   ```

2. Navigate to each component's configuration directory and follow the setup instructions in the respective markdown files.

3. Start all services in the following order:
   - Elasticsearch
   - Kibana
   - Logstash
   - Filebeat
   - Suricata

4. Access Kibana through your web browser and import the provided dashboards for Suricata log visualization.
